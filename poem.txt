Weâ€™ve discussed how you can make a fungible token
using ERC20, but what if not all
tokens are alike? This comes up in situations 
like real estate or collectibles, where some 
items are valued more than others, due to 
their usefulness,rarity, etc. ERC721 is a 
standard for representing ownership of 
non-fungible tokens, that is, where each
token is unique.
